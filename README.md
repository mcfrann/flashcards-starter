## Wins
	
  Although I know I have a lot to improve on, I was proud of myself for how quickly I grasped the concept of Test Driven Development. I found writing the tests to be pretty straightforward and even though I ran into a couple hiccups, I trust that the gaps in my knowledge will be filled soon enough.

## Challenges + Improvements
	
  I struggled specifically with getting the percentage of correct answers to be printed to the console. It took me a while to realize that I needed to `console.log` the result in my `Round.endRound()` method vs only returning it (although I still returned is to run a test on it in an easier way). I also struggled to grasp the syntax of `beforeEach` as most of the hook resources I found online seemed pretty vague in explanation, but thankfully my classmates helped me out with that!
